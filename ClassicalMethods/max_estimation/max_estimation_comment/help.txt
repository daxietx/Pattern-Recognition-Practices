All the input dataset should be in the form of ¡®*.txt¡¯, and it's your responsibility to provide proper training set, which could make a big difference on your classfication on test set.
The data in the dataset should always be like "class1 feature1 feature2 ......featurek
                                              "class2 feature1 feature2 ......featurek
                                               ...
                                               classx feature1 feature2 ......featurek"
The labels of classes must be successive and the users will provide the smallest biggest value of class labels, and the number of features. 
We provided four basic classifier, which users could choose from the UI. And we also provided adaboost for "Batch Relaxation with Margin".
all the alforithm provided give the users choices for parameters, and default values.
